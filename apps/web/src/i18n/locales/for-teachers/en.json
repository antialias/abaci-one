      "p1": "You know the problem. Over video, you can't see your student's abacus clearly. You can't tell if their beads are in the right position. You're squinting at a grainy camera feed while trying to teach friends-of-10 carries. The physical nature of the abacus — its greatest strength in person — becomes its biggest liability on a screen.",
      "p2": "We built the tools that fix this. Computer vision that sees and reads the abacus for you. Adaptive problem generation that knows each student's weak spots. Skill reporting that would take you hours to compile manually. Everything a soroban teacher needs to teach effectively, whether your student is across the table or across the country."

      "autoRead": "The abacus value is read automatically",
      "autoReadDesc": "Computer vision detects the bead positions and enters the value, so the student stays focused on solving the problem instead of typing answers. As they work through each term, checkmarks appear in real time showing their progress.",

      "liveTeachingDesc": "You see the current problem, the student's abacus, and their progress — all in one view. Pause the session when you need to explain something. Manipulate their on-screen abacus to demonstrate a technique. This is a teaching tool, not just an assignment tool.",

Is it friends-of-5 addition that's shaky, or friends-of-10 carrying? Heaven bead subtraction or simple complements? With a physical abacus and manual observation, this is incredibly hard to tease apart.",

      "targetingDesc": "The adaptive problem generator uses the BKT model to select problems that exercise the skills each student most needs to practice. Weak skills get more reps. Strong skills get maintained. You can override this per student if you disagree with the model.",
