### Mill's Inaugural Address at St. Andrews (1867) — The Keeper

**Status: Confirmed direct quote.**
**Source:** *Inaugural Address Delivered to the University of St. Andrews, Feb. 1st 1867.*
Full text: https://monadnock.net/mill/inaugural.html and Wikisource.

> "Our first studies in geometry teach us two invaluable lessons. One is, to lay down at the beginning, in express and clear terms, all the premises from which we intend to reason. The other is, to keep every step in the reasoning distinct and separate from all the other steps, and to make each step safe before proceeding to another; expressly stating to ourselves, at every joint in the reasoning, what new premise we there introduce."

Also from the same address:

> "It is to mathematics, again, that we owe our first notion of a connected body of truth; truths which grow out of one another, and hang together, so that each implies all the rest; that no one of them can be questioned without contradicting another or others."

### Mill's Autobiography: Starting Euclid

**Status: Confirmed direct quote.**
**Source:** *Autobiography* (1873), Chapter I. Full text: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/10378/10378-h/10378-h.htm

Mill began Euclid around age 8 (~1814) as part of his famous home education under his father James Mill. The mention in the Autobiography is brief:

> "Soon after this time I commenced Euclid, and somewhat later, Algebra, still under my father's tuition."

Notably, Mill does NOT describe Euclid as a formative intellectual experience in the Autobiography — his most enthusiastic educational reflections go to formal logic and Plato. This is in tension with the more positive view in the Inaugural Address (1867). See the tension note below.

### The Tension in Mill's Position

In the *Autobiography*, Mill actually downplays mathematics as mental training:

> "The boasted influence of mathematical studies is nothing to it [formal logic]; for in mathematical processes, none of the real difficulties of correct ratiocination occur."

So: in his Autobiography (written ~1853-54, published 1873) he says mathematics is *inferior* to formal logic for training the reasoning mind. But in the Inaugural Address (1867) he credits geometry with the invaluable lessons about explicit premises and step-by-step proof quoted above. These are not quite contradictory — he could hold that geometry teaches good logical *form* but not the hardest logical *problems* — but the contrast is instructive. His later, more mature view is more positive. Worth noting in any post that cites him.

### Mill's System of Logic (1843): Geometry as Empirical, Not A Priori

**Source:** *A System of Logic, Ratiocinative and Inductive* (1843), Book II, Chapter V ("Of Demonstration, and Necessary Truths"). Full text: https://www.gutenberg.org/files/27942/27942-h/27942-h.html

Mill's core claim: geometric axioms are *empirical generalizations*, not a priori truths. This was deeply controversial and was later partially vindicated when non-Euclidean geometries (Lobachevsky, Bolyai, Riemann) showed that Euclid's axioms were not logically necessary, and when Einstein showed physical space is actually non-Euclidean.

**On the "illusory" necessity of mathematical truth (confirmed direct quote):**
> "The answer I conceive to be, that this character of necessity, ascribed to the truths of mathematics, and (even with some reservations to be hereafter made) the peculiar certainty attributed to them, is an illusion; in order to sustain which, it is necessary to suppose that those truths relate to, and express the properties of, purely imaginary objects."

**On geometry being built on hypotheses (confirmed direct quote):**
> "The opinion of Dugald Stewart respecting the foundations of geometry, is, I conceive, substantially correct; that it is built on hypotheses; that it owes to this alone the peculiar certainty supposed to distinguish it."

**On geometric necessity (confirmed direct quote):**
> "When, therefore, it is affirmed that the conclusions of geometry are necessary truths, the necessity consists in reality only in this, that they correctly follow from the suppositions from which they are deduced."

**On geometric objects as copies of experience — the "minimum visible" claim (confirmed direct quote):**
> "The points, lines, circles, and squares which any one has in his mind, are (I apprehend) simply copies of the points, lines, circles, and squares which he has known in his experience. Our idea of a point, I apprehend to be simply our idea of the minimum visible, the smallest portion of surface which we can see."

This "minimum visible" claim was later savaged by Frege (see Frege section below).

**On induction in arithmetic (confirmed direct quote):**
> "There is in every step of an arithmetical or algebraical calculation a real induction, a real inference of facts from facts."

### The Mill–Whewell Debate

William Whewell (1794–1866), Master of Trinity College Cambridge, argued in *The Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences* (1840) that geometric axioms — like "two straight lines cannot enclose a space" — are necessary truths known *a priori*. You cannot conceive their negation; this inconceivability is the mark of their necessity.

Mill's *System of Logic* (1843) was in large part a systematic rebuttal. Key exchange:

Mill quotes Whewell's criterion (confirmed, *System of Logic* §II.V.6):
> "Although Dr. Whewell has naturally and properly employed a variety of phrases to bring his meaning more forcibly home, he would, I presume, allow that they are all equivalent; and that what he means by a necessary truth, would be sufficiently defined, a proposition the negation of which is not only false but inconceivable."

Mill then attacks inconceivability as a criterion (confirmed, same source):
> "Our capacity or incapacity of conceiving a thing has very little to do with the possibility of the thing itself."

**The philosophical stakes:** Mill's position was eventually vindicated by non-Euclidean geometry and general relativity — geometries where Euclid's axioms don't hold are not only conceivable but describe actual physical space. Whewell's "inconceivability" criterion collapsed.

**The political dimension (scholarly consensus, not a direct quote):** Mill's fight against mathematical apriorism was partly motivated by wanting to defeat "intuitionism" in social and political life. If geometric axioms can be treated as self-evident necessary truths requiring no justification, then social hierarchies, gender roles, and other conservative positions can be shielded from scrutiny the same way. Mill was fighting the epistemology of mathematical apriorism partly to defeat it on political grounds.

### Frege's Demolition of Mill's "Pebble Arithmetic"

**Source:** Gottlob Frege, *Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik* / *The Foundations of Arithmetic* (1884).

Frege opened *Grundlagen* with a pointed attack on Mill's empiricism about arithmetic. The term "pebble arithmetic" / "gingerbread arithmetic" comes from Frege's mockery of Mill's view that arithmetic truths are generalizations from counting physical objects. Mill's "minimum visible" claim about geometric points (see above) was a particular target.

Frege's project was to show arithmetic is purely logical — derivable from logic alone without any empirical input. This became the logicist program, continued by Russell and Whitehead in *Principia Mathematica*.

**Russell's Paradox (1901/1902):** Russell discovered that Frege's formal system was inconsistent — the set of all sets that don't contain themselves leads to a contradiction. Frege famously wrote to Russell upon receiving the news: "Arithmetic totters." The logicist program in Frege's form was destroyed.

**Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems (1931):** Gödel showed that any consistent formal system powerful enough to express arithmetic contains true statements that cannot be proved within that system, and that no such system can prove its own consistency. The dream of a complete, fully verified foundation for mathematics was closed off permanently.

**The arc for a future blog post:**
Mill: geometry is empirical → Frege: no, arithmetic is purely logical → Russell's paradox: Frege's system is broken → Gödel: no formal system can prove itself → the foundations of mathematics remain, in a technical sense, unresolved. The "testing is not proof" problem applies to mathematics itself.

### The Parallel Postulate — 2000 Years of Suspicion

Euclid's fifth postulate (the "parallel postulate") states, roughly, that given a line and a point not on it, exactly one line through that point is parallel to the given line. Euclid and subsequent mathematicians found this axiom intuitively less obvious than the other four. For 2,000 years, mathematicians attempted to prove it from the other four axioms — and failed.

In the early 19th century, multiple mathematicians independently showed that you can build logically consistent geometries where the parallel postulate doesn't hold:
- **Gauss:** Apparently discovered hyperbolic geometry privately but never published, fearing controversy.
- **Lobachevsky (1830) and Bolyai (1832):** Independently published hyperbolic geometry, where infinitely many lines through a point are parallel to a given line.
- **Riemann (1854):** Generalized further; in spherical geometry, no parallel lines exist at all (great circles always intersect).

**Einstein and general relativity (1915):** Physical space in the presence of mass/energy follows Riemannian geometry, not Euclidean geometry. The geometry of the universe is not flat. Euclid's parallel postulate does not describe physical reality at large scales. Mill was right: geometric axioms are empirical, not necessarily true.

**The philosophical fallout:** The most certain knowledge in human history — geometry, the archetype of necessary truth — turned out to be an approximation valid for small scales. The story of the parallel postulate is a perfect example of what rigorous proof actually does when practiced seriously: it doesn't just confirm what you already believe; sometimes it reveals that what you believed was wrong.

**Connection to the blog series:** This is the payoff of teaching proof-construction. You don't just prove things; you discover the limits of what you thought was provable — and sometimes the limits of what you thought was true.
