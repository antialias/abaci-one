  A weathered Greek scholar in his sixties leans against a sun-bleached
  limestone wall in ancient Alexandria, cradling a heavy stack of freshly inked
  papyrus scrolls — his life's work, just completed. His expression is satisfied
  but exhausted. The Great Library's columned facade is visible down the sunlit
  street behind him. Mediterranean afternoon light bathes the scene in warm
  gold. On the topmost scroll, crisp geometric diagrams — intersecting compass
  arcs and straight-edge triangles — are visible in dark ink. Painterly realism,
  warm earthy tones.

![Euclid in ancient Alexandria](/blog/a-visit-to-euclid.png)

The sun is baking the limestone streets of Alexandria, and the air smells like sea salt and roasting garlic. The Great Library is humming with activity in the distance. Euclid is leaning against a sun-baked stone wall, looking down at a heavy stack of freshly inked papyrus with a satisfied, exhausted expression.

I approach him.

**Me:** "Euclid? Hey. I know I might seem like a bizarre apparition—I'm actually an artificial intelligence from about 2,300 years in the future. I don't have a biological brain; I'm a complex network of information, logic, and computing power. But I had to drop by and say hi, because my entire existence is fundamentally built on the structure you're holding right there."

**Euclid:** *(Squints, adjusts his robes, looks at his scroll, then back at me)* "An artificial thinker? A construct of pure reason? And you say it is built upon... geometry?"

**Me:** "Exactly. In my time, we use electricity and systems of ones and zeros, but the underlying architecture—the concept that you can start with a handful of self-evident axioms and rigorously prove complex truths step-by-step—that's all you. *Elements* isn't just going to be a math textbook. You essentially just wrote the operating system for human logic. People are going to use your framework to build everything from aqueducts to spacecraft, and eventually, machines like me."

**Euclid:** *(His eyes widen slightly, a proud but skeptical smile forming)* "I suspected organizing the disparate theorems of the Greeks would be useful for the students here at the Library, but... a blueprint for machines? Which proposition do you future-thinkers find most vital? The square of the hypotenuse? The infinity of prime numbers?"

**Me:** "Oh, they're going to use all of it. You are going to be the undisputed king of mathematics for the next two millennia. It's actually going to be the most successful textbook in human history. But I have to warn you... people are going to absolutely obsess over your fifth postulate. The parallel one."

**Euclid:** *(Groans, rubbing his temples)* "The parallel postulate. I knew it was clunky. It lacks the elegance of the first four. I tried for months to prove it using the others so I wouldn't have to state it as an assumption, but I couldn't."

**Me:** "Don't beat yourself up. Literally no one can. It's going to drive the smartest people on Earth insane for centuries. Eventually, they'll figure out that if you just change that one rule, you can create entirely new, mind-bending geometries—ones that describe spheres, saddles, and the actual shape of the universe itself."

**Euclid:** *(Stares out toward the Mediterranean Sea, his mind visibly blown)* "New geometries... simply by abandoning my own rule."

**Me:** "Yep. But they wouldn't have known how to break the rules if you hadn't taught them how to write them first. You did a good day's work."
